<h1>前置 (Fronts)</h1>
<p class="NoIndent">
	「前置」是記載著GM知識情報的秘密典籍。每一個前置都是一系列危險的集合──它們是特別針對角色們的威脅，並同樣危害著角色們所關心的人們、地點、以及事物。它同時也包括了一個或多個逼近而至的災厄，代表著若角色們不加以阻止就會降臨的可怕慘事。「前置」源自英文中的「戰線（fronts）」一詞，代表你打算讓角色們面對的處境──讓他們被你預先擺放的威脅、危險和冒險給環繞。</p>
<p>
	前置的創造過程發生在遊戲之外。它們是你在遊戲與遊戲之間空檔時獨自享受的樂趣──隨著你摩拳擦掌，對自己發出邪惡的笑聲，你也將一邊設計出那些用來挑戰玩家角色們的敵人與威脅。你可以在遊戲過程中調整或修改你前置的內容（誰知道到時候會迸出什麼樣的靈感呢？），但它們最主要的部分源自於你在聚會與聚會之間進行的準備工作。</p>
<p>
	前置被設計用來幫助你組織你的想法，協助你釐清有什麼事物將與玩家們作對。它們包括了關於敵對勢力的筆記、靈感想法、以及陰謀計畫。當你茫然無措，不知道下一步該如何進行時，這些前置就是你該看向的地方，說出「噢，所以<b>這些</b>就是我該做的事」。把它們當作一種規劃工具，並做為當下或未來混亂局面的靈感來源。</p>
<p>
	當你在構築前置時，想想所有你希望在你遊戲中出現的詭異地城居民、那些肆虐的部族、以及古老的邪教。首先以宏觀的角度思考它們，接著，在你為前置創造危害的過程中，你將能縮小這些想法的範圍，使其更為具體。當你在撰寫戰役前置時，想想每次聚會中發生的故事走向。而當你撰寫冒險前置的時候，則想想在此時此地有什麼重要的事情。在你寫完幾個前置之後，你也就預備好了所有你在挑戰玩家時所需要的工具，並準備好可以開始主持地城世界了。</p>

<h3>何時該創造前置</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	你將在你的第一次聚會<b>之後</b>創作你的 <u>戰役前置</u> 和第一個 <u>冒險前置</u>。你可能不會在第一次創作時就完成你的戰役前置──這樣很好！就跟地圖上的適度留白一樣，戰役前置中的那些未知部分正是你留待未來發揮創意的機會。</p>
<p>
	在第一次聚會後，你也會創作一些冒險前置。一到二個通常會是不錯的數量，而若你發現自己有更多關於冒險前置的想法，你可以考慮暫時先把它們寫成筆記紀錄下來就好，等到以後再拿出來使用。</p>

<h3>戰役前置 和 冒險前置</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	所有前置的核心都包含著相同的構成要件。它們能夠幫助你把你設計的危害分類並整理成易於使用的集合。這些前置被分成了兩個種類：分別是戰役前置、以及冒險前置。冒險前置是那些你在聚會間所使用的材料，每個這類前置都可以用於數次聚會之中。它們聯繫著某個難題或挑戰，並會隨著角色們徘徊於地城或揭露某個故事情節時而被處理或擱置。把它們當作影劇中某一集的情節內容：「今天，在地城世界……」</p>
<p>
	將你的冒險前置與你的戰役前置聯繫在一起。若說冒險前置的內容包含了立即性的危險──也許獸人們入侵了哈格羅什山口──那麼戰役前置可能就會是關於黑暗之神格里什卡的威脅，也許正是祂驅使著這群獸人四處劫掠。戰役前置是貫穿你整個地城世界遊戲內容的元素。它會有著更緩慢逼近的惡兆，更廣闊的影響範圍，並會對這個世界帶來更深遠的衝擊。最重要的是，如果這些災厄真的降臨了，那它帶來的後果也會更令人恐懼。</p>
<p>
	如果某個源自於冒險前置的危害沒有被順利解決，那麼你將需要做出決定。如果你中意這個危害、且覺得它值得在你遊戲中的世界佔有更大的位置，不要猶豫，儘管放手把它挪到戰役前置中。你永遠可以讓那些未被解決掉的渺小危害在日後發展成更大的危機。當然，如果某個戰役前置中的危害讓你備感壓力，你也可以選擇把它搬到冒險前置之中。</p>

<hr/>
<h2>創造前置 (Creating Fronts)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">以下是構築一個前置的流程與要件：</p>
<ul>
	<li>選擇要創建 戰役前置 還是 冒險前置</li>
	<li>創造 2-3 個 危害</li>
	<li>為每個 危害 選擇一個 臨頭大難</li>
	<li>添加 惡兆 (冒險前置約 1-3 個, 戰役前置約 3-5 個)</li>
	<li>撰寫 1–3 個 懸念</li>
	<li>列出前置的大概登場人物</li></ul>

<h2>Creating Dangers</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">Not every element of your game will warrant a danger—traps, some roving monsters, and other bits of ephemera may just be there to add context but aren’t important enough to warrant inclusion. That’s okay. Fronts are here to keep you apprised of the bigger picture. Dangers are divided into a handful of categories, each with its own name and <strong>impulse</strong>.</p>
<p>Every danger has a crucial motivation that drives it called its impulse. The impulse exists to help you understand that danger. What pushes it to fulfill its impending doom? Impulses can help you translate the danger into action.</p>
<p>When creating dangers for your front, think about how each one interacts as a facet of the front as a whole. Keep in mind the people, places, and things that might be a part of the threat to the world that the front represents. How does each danger contribute to the front?</p>
<p class="Example">Let’s say we have an idea for a front—an ancient portal has been discovered in the icy north. We’ll call our front “The Opening of the White Gate.”</p>
<p class="NoIndent">The easiest place to start is with people and monsters. Cultists, ogre chieftains, demonic overlords, and the like are all excellent dangers. These are the creatures that have risen above mere monster status to become serious threats on their own. Groups of monsters can be dangers too—goblin tribes or a rampaging centaur khanate, for example.</p>
<p class="Example">For the front we’re creating, we can pick a few different groups or people who might be interested in the gate. The College of Arcanists, perhaps. There’s a golem, too, we’ve decided, that protects the forgotten portal. The golem is just an obstacle, so we won’t make him a danger.</p>
<p class="NoIndent">Thinking more broadly, less obvious elements of the world can be dangers. Blasted landscapes, intelligent magical items, ancient spells woven into the fabric of time. These things fulfill the same purposes as a mad necromancer—they’re part of the front, a danger to the world.</p>
<p class="Example">For our front, we’ll add the gate itself as a danger.</p>
<p class="NoIndent">Lastly, if we think ahead, we can include some overarching dangers. The sorts of things that are in play outside the realm of the obvious—godly patrons, hidden conspiracies and cursed prophecies waiting to be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Example">Perhaps the White Gate was carved in the ancient past, hidden by a race of angels until the Day of Judgement. We’ll add the Argent Seraphim to our front as a new danger.</p>
<p class="NoIndent">There’s always more dangers you could add to a front, but limit yourself to 3 at most and leave room for discovery. Like a map, blank spaces can always be filled in later. Leaving room for player contribution and future inspiration means you’ll have freedom to alter the front and make it fit the game. Not every bad thing that could happen deserves to be made into a danger. If you’re uncertain, think about it this way: dangers can always get worse.</p>
<p class="Example">A barbarian tribe near the gate, the frozen tundra itself, a band of rival adventurers; all these things could be dangerous elements of the game but they’re not important enough just yet to deserve to be dangers.</p>
<p class="NoIndent">Creating dangers is a way to slice up your overall front concept into smaller, easier to manage pieces. Dangers are tools for adding detail to the right parts of the front and for making the front easier to manage in the long run.</p>
<p>Once you’ve named and added a danger to the front you need to choose a type for that danger from the list below. Alternately, you can use the list of types to inspire dangers: with your front in mind, peruse the list and pick one or two that fit.</p>
<p class="Example">For our three dangers (The College of Arcanists, The White Gate and the Argent Seraphim) we’ve selected Cabal, Dark Portal and Choir of Angels, respectively.</p>

<h3>描述與登場人物 (Description and Cast)</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">Write up something short to remind you just what this danger is about, something to describe it in a nutshell. Don’t worry about where it’s going or what could happen—grim portents and the impending doom will handle that for you; you’ll get to those in a bit. If there are multiple people involved in the danger (an orc warlord and his clansmen, a hateful god and his servants) go ahead and give them names and a detail or two now. Leave yourself some space as you’ll be adding to this section as you play.</p>

<h3>自訂動作 (Custom Moves)</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">Sometimes a danger will suggest a move that isn’t covered by any existing ones. You can write custom moves to fill the gaps or to add the right effects for the danger. They can be player moves or GM moves, as you see fit. Of course, if you’re writing a player move, keep your hands off the dice and mind the basic structure of a move. A 10+ is a complete success, while a 7–9 is a partial success. On a miss, maybe the custom move does something specific, or maybe not—maybe you just get to make a move or work towards fulfilling a grim portent. The formatting of these moves varies from move to move.</p>
<p class="Example">For the Opening of the White Gate, I just know some fool PC is going to end up in the light that spills from the gate, so I’m writing a move to show what might occur.</p>
<p class="Example">When you <strong>stand in the presence of the Light From Beyond</strong>, roll+WIS: ✴On a 10+ you are judged worthy, the Argent Seraphim will grant you a vision or boon. ✴On a 7-9 you are under suspicion and see a vision of what dark fate might befall you if you do not correct your ways. ✴On a miss, thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting.</p>

<h3>惡兆 (Grim Portents)</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">Grim portents are dark designs for what could happen if a danger goes unchecked. Think about what would happen if the danger existed in the world but the PCs didn’t—if all these awful things you’ve conjured up had their run of the world. Scary, huh? The grim portents are your way to codify the plans and machinations of your dangers. A grim portent can be a single interesting event or a chain of steps. When you’re not sure what to do next, push your danger towards resolving a grim portent.</p>
<p>More often than not grim portents have a logical order. The orcs tear down the city only after the peace talks fail, for example. A simple front will progress from bad to worse to much worse in a clear path forward. Sometimes, grim portents are unconnected pathways to the impending doom. The early manifestations of danger might not all be related. It’s up to you to decide how complex your front will be. Whenever a danger comes to pass, check the other dangers in the front. In a complex front, you may need to cross off or alter the grim portents. That’s fine, you’re allowed. Keep scale in mind, too. Grim portents don’t all have to be world-shaking. They can simply represent a change in direction for a danger. Some new way for it to cause trouble in the world.</p>
<p>Think of your grim portents as possible moves waiting in the wings. When the time is right, unleash them on the world.</p>
<p class="Example">I’ve chosen a few grim portents for my new front.</p>
<ul><li class="Exampleli">The College sends an expedition to the Gate</li>
<li class="Exampleli">The Key is discovered</li>
<li class="Exampleli">The First Trumpet sounds</li>
<li class="Exampleli">A Champion is chosen</li>
<li class="Exampleli">The Second Trumpet sounds</li>
<li class="Exampleli">The Herald appears</li>
<li class="Exampleli">The Gate is Opened</li></ul>
<p class="NoIndent">When a grim portent comes to pass, check it off—the prophecy has come true! A grim portent that has come to pass might have ramifications for your other fronts, too. Have a quick look when your players aren’t demanding your attention and feel free to make changes. One small grim portent may resound across the whole campaign in subtle ways.</p>
<p>You can advance a grim portent descriptively or prescriptively. Descriptively means that you’ve seen the change happen during play, so you mark it off. Maybe the players sided with the goblin tribes against their lizardman enemies—now the goblins control the tunnels. Lo and behold, this was the next step in a grim portent. Prescriptive is when, due to a failed player move or a golden opportunity, you advance the grim portent as your hard move. That step comes to pass, show its effects and keep on asking, “What do you do, now?”</p>

<h3>臨頭大難 (Impending Doom)</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">
	每個危害最終都通往一個臨頭大難。
At the end of every danger’s path is an impending doom. This is the final toll of the bell that signals the danger’s triumphant resolution. When a grim portent comes to pass the impending doom grows stronger, more apparent and present in the world. These are the very bad things that every danger, in some way, seeks to bring into effect. Choose one of the types of impending dooms and give it a concrete form in your front. These often change in play, as the characters meddle in the affairs of the world. Don’t fret, you can change them later.</p>
<ul><li>Tyranny (of the strong over the weak or the few over the many)</li>
<li>Pestilence (the spread of sickness and disease, the end of wellness)</li>
<li>Destruction (apocalypse, ruin and woe)</li>
<li>Usurpation (the chain of order comes apart, someone rightful is displaced)</li>
<li>Impoverishment (enslavement, the abandonment of goodness and right)</li>
<li>Rampant Chaos (laws of reality, of society, or any order is dissolved)</li></ul>
<p>When all of the grim portents of a danger come to pass, the impending doom sets in. The danger is then resolved but the setting has changed in some meaningful way. This will almost certainly change the front at large as well. Making sure that these effects reverberate throughout the world is a big part of making them feel real.</p>

<h3>懸念 (Stakes)</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">Your stakes questions are 1-3 questions about people, places, or groups that you’re interested in. People include PCs and NPCs, your choice. Remember that your agenda includes “Play to find out what happens?” Stakes are a way of reminding yourself what you want to find out.</p>
<p>Stakes are concrete and clear. Don’t write stakes about vague feelings or incremental changes. Stakes are about important changes that affect the PCs and the world. A good stakes question is one that, when it’s resolved, means that things will never be the same again.</p>
<p>The most important thing about stakes is that you find them interesting. Your stakes should be things that you genuinely want to know, but that you’re also willing to leave to be resolved through play. Once you’ve written it as a stake, it’s out of your hands, you don’t get to just make it up anymore. Now you have to play to find out.</p>
<p>Playing to find out is one of the biggest rewards of playing Dungeon World. You’ve written down something tied to events happening in the world that you want to find out about—now you get to do just that.</p>
<p>Once you have your stakes your front is ready to play.</p>
<div class="Example"><p>My stakes questions include, as tailored to my group:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;"><li class="Exampleli">Who will be the champion?</li>
<li class="Exampleli">How will Lux respond to the Light From Beyond?</li>
<li class="Exampleli">Will the College be able to recruit Avon?</li></ul></div>

<h2>Resolving a Front</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">Often a front will be resolved in a simple and straightforward manner. A front representing a single dungeon may have its dangers killed, turned to good, or overcome by some act of heroism. In this case the front is dissolved and set aside. Maybe there are elements of the front—dangers that go unresolved or leftover members of a danger that’s been cleared—that live on. Maybe they move to the campaign front as brand new dangers?</p>
<p>The campaign front will need a bit more effort to resolve. It’ll be working slowly and subtly as the course of the campaign rolls along. You won’t introduce or resolve it all at once, but in pieces. The characters work towards defeating the various minions of the big bad that lives in your campaign front. In the end, though, you’ll know that the campaign front is resolved when the Dark God is confronted or the undead plague claims the world and the heroes emerge bloodied but victorious or defeated and despairing. Campaign fronts take longer to deal with but in the end they’re the most satisfying to resolve.</p>
<p>When a front is resolved take some extra time to sit down and look at the aftermath. Did any grim portents come to pass? Even if a danger is stopped, if any grim portents are fulfilled, the world is changed, if only in subtle ways. Keep this in mind when you write your future fronts. Is there anyone who could be moved from the now-defeated front to somewhere else? Anyone get promoted or reduced in stature? The resolution of a front is an important event!</p>
<p>When you resolve an adventure front usually that means the adventure itself has been resolved. This is a great time to take a break and look at your campaign front. Let it inspire your next adventure front. Write up a new adventure front or polish off one you’ve been working on, draw a few maps to go with it and get ready for the next big thing.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Multiple Adventure Fronts</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">As you start your campaign you’re likely to have a lightly detailed campaign front and one or two detailed adventure fronts. Characters may choose, part-way through an adventure, to pursue some other course. You might end up with a handful of partly-resolved adventure fronts. Not only is this okay, it’s a great way to explore a world that feels alive and organic. Always remember, fronts continue along apace no matter whether the characters are there to see them or not. Think offscreen, especially where fronts are concerned.</p>
<p>When running two adventure fronts at the same time they can be intertwined or independent. The anarchists corrupting the city from the inside are a different front from the orcs massing outside the walls, but they’d both be in play at once. On the other hand one dungeon could have multiple fronts at play within its walls: the powers and effects of the cursed place itself and the warring humanoid tribes that inhabit it.</p>
<p>A situation warrants multiple adventure fronts when there are multiple impending dooms, all equally potent but not necessarily related. The impending doom of the anarchists is chaos in the city, the impending doom of the orcs is its utter ruination. They are two separate fronts with their own dangers. They’ll deal with each other, as well, so there’s some room for the players choosing sides or attempting to turn the dangers of one front against the other.</p>
<p>When dealing with multiple adventure fronts the players are likely to prioritize. The cult needs attention now, the orcs can wait, or vice versa. These decisions lead to the slow advancement of the neglected front, eventually causing more problems for the characters and leading to new adventures. This can get complex once you’ve got three or four fronts in play. Take care not to get overwhelmed.</p>

<h1>擔任GM</h1>
<p class="NoIndent">
	奇幻風格有許多種不同的類別，每一種類別對於如何主持遊戲也會有不同的風格和建議。地城世界是專門為其中一種風格而設計的──一個存在著精靈、獸人、龍、和魔法的世界，在這裡，黑暗深沉的危險與輕鬆愉快的冒險彼此交織。本章節中的規則將協助你以這種風格來主持遊戲。</p>
<p>
	角色們在擲骰和採取行動時需要遵守規則。而做為GM，你也有必須遵守的規則。在遊戲過程中，你將會需要裁決、宣判、並描述這個世界的變化──地城世界為此提供了一個框架來指導你該如何主持遊戲。</p>
<p>
	本章節的內容並不是提供給GM的建議、也不是關於那些讓你更好遊玩地城世界遊戲的選用技巧和訣竅，而是為任何打算擔當GM位置的人提供應該遵守的程序和規則。</p>

<h4>主持地城世界：框架</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">
	地城世界這個遊戲的運行基礎主要建立於下列幾個要素；GM的<strong>目標事項</strong>、<strong>原則</strong>、和<strong>動作</strong>。目標事項代表著你在遊戲中預計要做到的事情。原則提供一些指引，讓你能專注於完成你的目標事項。GM動作則是那些你在每時每刻用來推動遊戲進行的實際手段。每當玩家擲骰失敗時、規則要求你這麼做時、或是玩家們看著你，等待你描述接下來發生的情況時，就是你使用這些動作的時機。你的動作將維持敘事的連貫性，並推進遊戲的發展。</p>
<p>
	GM的目標事項、原則、和動作，就跟傷害、屬性或HP一樣，同樣屬於規則的一部份。也因此，若你打算修改它們的運作方式或忽略它們，你必須像對待其他規則一樣小心地處理它們。</p>

<hr/>
<h2>如何擔任GM</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">
	當你以GM的身分在桌邊坐下時，你需要做這些事情：</p>
<ul>
	<li>描述故事情境</li>
	<li>遵守規則</li>
	<li>使用動作</li>
	<li>善用你的事前準備</li></ul>
<p class="NoIndent">
	玩家們要做的事比較簡單──他們只需要說出他們角色會說的話、所想的事、以及會採取的行動。你的任務稍微困難一點，你必須說出除此之外的所有一切。這代表什麼意思呢？</p>
<p>
	首先，也是最重要的，你需要<strong>隨時描述玩家們周遭環境的即時狀況</strong>。這同時是你讓聚會開始的方法，也是當你打算在短暫的休息後、或開了個有趣的玩笑之後讓故事回到正軌時所需要做的事情：用清晰具體的詞彙告訴玩家他們身處於什麼樣的情境中。</p>
<p>
	利用細節和感官描述來讓玩家身歷其境。情境並不僅僅是「一頭獸人朝你衝鋒」，而是「一頭渾身浴血的獸人揮舞重槌，怒吼著朝你衝鋒而來」。你也可以反過來利用零碎的訊息來營造氣氛，比如說僅僅給出金屬鎧甲碰撞的噪音、或事拖著腳走路發出的足音。</p>
<p>
	玩家身邊的情境鮮少會是「一切都很好，什麼都不用擔心」。他們是正在經歷冒險的冒險者──給他們一些東西去應付！</p>
<p>
	當你描述情境時，永遠記得以「你打算做什麼？」結尾。地城世界是個充滿動作場景與冒險的遊戲，描繪出一個要求玩家們立即做出反應的情境吧！</p>
<p>
	確保你從一開始就<strong>遵守規則</strong>。這裡指的是你的GM動作，當然，但也記得時時注意玩家們的動作是否符合規則進行。每個人都有責任去注意某個動作是否有被觸發，這也包括你在內。當某個玩家的行動看起來像是準備觸發一條規則的時候，請他暫停描述，並詢問確認他們是否打算要這麼做。</p>
<p>
	<strong>進行動作</strong>是你需要遵守的其中一部分規則。你的GM動作與玩家截然不同，我們稍後會再仔細地介紹這些動作。你的動作會明確定義你能做的事情，並藉此改變遊戲的流向。</p>
<p>
	在上述這些環節中，同時也要記得<strong>善用你的事前準備</strong>。有時候你會知道一些玩家們還不知道的情報，你可以利用這些情報來協助你進行動作。當法師在施法的同時引來了不必要的注意，玩家們還不會知道他們引來的注意是什麼，但你很清楚，就在兩層樓之下，那可怖惡魔的不祥視線已經落在他們身上。</p>

<hr/>
<h2>目標事項 (Agenda)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">
	你的目標事項記載了你在主持地城世界的期間，始終要去達成的事項：</p>
<ul>
	<li>描繪出一個奇幻世界</li>
	<li>讓角色們的生命充滿冒險</li>
	<li>用玩的來看看會發生什麼事</li></ul>

<p class="NoIndent">
	任何你在遊戲桌上（以及遊戲桌外）所說所做的一切，都是為了完成這三個目標而存在的。這三者以外的都不是你的目標：你不是為了打敗玩家或考驗他們解決複雜陷阱的能力而來；你在這裡不是為了讓玩家們有機會探索你精心打造的世界觀設定；也不是為了殺死玩家（儘管故事中的怪物們可能會這麼打算）。你更不是為了跟大家講述一個已經被計畫好的故事，才來擔任這個遊戲的GM的。</p>
<p>
	你的第一個目標事項是<strong>描繪出一個奇幻世界</strong>。地城世界是個充滿了膽識、智謀、以及對抗黑暗和災厄的勇氣的遊戲，講述著那些決定投身冒險生活，冀望於其中贏得光輝榮耀的角色們。你的職責是參與其中，將一個能提供角色冒險的世界展現在玩家面前。若沒有了玩家角色，這個世界將會陷入混亂或毀滅──雖然就算他們在場也可能如此。由你決定該如何描繪這個世界的奇幻要素，向玩家們展現這個世界的驚奇與美好，並鼓勵他們做出反應。</p>
<p>
	<strong>讓角色們的生命充滿冒險</strong>意味著與玩家們共同打造出一個迷人且充滿變化的世界。冒險者總是會被捲入某種危害整個世界的威脅之中──在遊戲中盡量鼓勵並培養這類行為。</p>
<p>
	地城世界的冒險<strong>永遠不會</strong>預設玩家的行動。地城世界的冒險會透過動態的方式描繪其背景設定──在某個重要的場所，大大小小的生物都各自追求著自己的目標，而當玩家們到來，並與環境和當地居民發生衝突時，他們將不可避免地採取各種行動。你要做的，就是誠實地描繪出這些行動所帶來的後果﹒</p>
<p>
	這正是你<strong>用玩的來看看會發生什麼事</strong>的方法。你與玩家們將共同分享發掘角色如何反應、以及改變你們所描繪世界的樂趣。你們全都參與著這場正逐漸揭開面紗的冒險故事。所以說真的，不要計畫太多，否則遊戲規則將與你作對。相信我們，在遊玩過程中看著事情如何發展，絕對別有一番風味。</p>
<p></p>

<hr/>
<h2>原則 (Principles)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>畫出地圖，但適度留白</li>
	<li>對角色說話，而非對玩家</li>
	<li>擁抱奇幻</li>
	<li>進行合乎發展的動作</li>
	<li>永遠不要說出你動作的名字</li>
	<li>賦予每個怪物生命</li>
	<li>為每個人物命名</li>
	<li>詢問，並利用得到的答案</li>
	<li>成為角色們的迷弟迷妹</li>
	<li>構思危險</li>
	<li>以敘事開始，以敘事做結</li>
	<li>也要記得思考幕後</li></ul>
<p class="NoIndent">
	你的原則就是引導你行事的指南。通常，當是時候進行動作的時候，你心中早已經有了一些關於該做些什麼的想法。參考你的原則評估它，若它符合原則的話，就放手做下去吧。</p>

<h4>畫出地圖，但適度留白</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">
	地城世界主要存在於玩家們的想像之中；而地圖能夠確保所有人都對此有著相同的共識。你不需要每次都由自己動手，但任何時候當有一個新的地點出現在故事中時，請確保它有被添加到地圖上。</p>
<p>
	當你繪製地圖時，不要嘗試把它填滿。保留一些空間給未知。隨著遊戲進行，你將會得到更多有趣的想法，而玩家們同時也會為你帶來絕佳的靈感。讓地圖隨之擴展，並產生變化。</p>

<h4>對角色說話，而非對玩家</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">
	「對角色說話，而非對玩家」代表著你不會說「東尼，你的敦威克有打算對那個死靈做些什麼嗎？」，相反的，你會說「敦威克，你打算對那個死靈做些什麼？」。用這種方式說話，能讓遊戲專注在故事中，而不會讓玩家們抽離。這對遊戲的運行同樣至關重要。若你對著玩家說話，你們可能會因此忽略一些對於角色採取的動作而言相當重要的細節。由於動作的進行永遠是建基在角色所採取的行動上，因此你會需要好好思考這些角色身上發生了什麼事──而不是扮演他們的玩家們。</p>

<h4>擁抱奇幻</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">
	魔法、奇異古怪的景色、諸神、惡魔、以及受憎之物：這個世界充滿著各種神祕和魔法。擁抱它們，將它們納入你的事前準備和遊戲中。試著考慮各種不同層級的「奇幻」事物。想想那使用舊神遺骸建造的浮空城市或島嶼；想想村莊中的智者和他們的靈魂魔寵、或者是那些當地匪徒傳說中那個能給觸碰者好運的雕像。玩家角色們都是些有趣的人物，他們或被神祇授予神力、或精通戰鬥的技術、或經歷過嚴苛的魔法訓練。而你的世界也該同樣的引人入勝。</p>

<h4>進行合乎發展的動作</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When you make a move what you’re actually doing is taking an element of the fiction and bringing it to bear against the characters. Your move should always follow from the fiction. They help you focus on one aspect of the current situation and do something interesting with it. What’s going on? What move makes sense here?</p>

<h4>永遠不要說出你動作的名字</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">There is no quicker way to ruin the consistency of Dungeon World than to tell the players what move you’re making. Your moves are prompts to you, not things you say directly.</p>
<p>You never show the players that you’re picking a move from a list. You know the reason the slavers dragged off Omar was because you made the “put someone in a spot” move, but you show it to the players as a straightforward outcome of their actions, since it is.</p>

<h4>賦予每個怪物生命</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Monsters are fantastic creatures with their own motivations (simple or complex). Give each monster details that bring it to life: smells, sights, sounds. Give each one enough to make it real, but don’t cry when it gets beat up or overthrown. That’s what player characters do!</p>

<h4>為每個人物命名</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">
	每個與玩家們對話的人物都有著自己的名字。他們也可能會有著自己的人格特質、或甚至抱有不平凡的目標或觀點，但這些東西都可以留待你進行遊戲期間再決定。首先，從名字開始，剩下的將隨故事發展衍生而出。</p>

<h4>詢問，並利用得到的答案</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Part of playing to find out what happens is explicitly not knowing everything, and being curious. If you don’t know something, or you don’t have an idea, ask the players and use what they say.</p>
<p>The easiest question to use is “What do you do?” Whenever you make a move, end with “What do you do?” You don’t even have to ask the person you made the move against. Take that chance to shift the focus elsewhere: “Rath’s spell is torn apart with a flick of the mage’s wand. Finnegan, that spell was aiding you. What are you doing now that it’s gone?”</p>

<h4>成為角色們的迷弟迷妹</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Think of the players’ characters as protagonists in a story you might see on TV. Cheer for their victories and lament their defeats. You’re not here to push them in any particular direction, merely to participate in fiction that features them and their action.</p>

<h4>構思危險</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Everything in the world is a target. You’re thinking like an evil overlord: no single life is worth anything and there is nothing sacrosanct. Everything can be put in danger, everything can be destroyed. Nothing you create is ever protected. Whenever your eye falls on something you’ve created, think how it can be put in danger, fall apart or crumble. The world changes. Without the characters’ intervention, it changes for the worse.</p>

<h4>以敘事開始，以敘事做結</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Everything you and the players do in Dungeon World comes from and leads to fictional events. When the players make a move, they take a fictional action to trigger it, apply the rules, and get a fictional effect. When you make a move it always comes from the fiction.</p>

<h4>也要記得思考幕後</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Just because you’re a fan of the characters doesn’t mean everything happens right in front of them. Sometimes your best move is in the next room, or another part of the dungeon, or even back in town. Make your move elsewhere and show its effects when they come into the spotlight.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>動作 (Moves)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">Whenever everyone looks to you to see what happens choose one of these. Each move is something that occurs in the fiction of the game—they aren’t code words or special terms. “Use up their resources” literally means to expend the resources of the characters, for example.</p>
<ul><li>Use a monster, danger, or location move</li>
<li>Reveal an unwelcome truth</li>
<li>Show signs of an approaching threat</li>
<li>Deal damage</li>
<li>Use up their resources</li>
<li>Turn their move back on them</li>
<li>Separate them</li>
<li>Give an opportunity that fits a class’ abilities</li>
<li>Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment</li>
<li>Offer an opportunity, with or without cost</li>
<li>Put someone in a spot</li>
<li>Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask</li></ul>
<p class="NoIndent">Never speak the name of your move (that’s one of your principles). Make it a real thing that happens to them: “As you dodge the hulking ogre’s club, you slip and land hard. Your sword goes sliding away into the darkness. You think you saw where it went but the ogre is lumbering your way. What do you do?”</p>
<p>No matter what move you make, always follow up with “What do you do?” Your moves are a way of fulfilling your agenda—part of which is to fill the characters’ lives with adventure. When a spell goes wild or the floor drops out from under them adventurers react or suffer the consequences of inaction.</p>
<h3>When to Make a Move</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">You make a move:</p>
<ul><li>When everyone looks to you to find out what happens</li>
<li>When the players give you a golden opportunity</li>
<li>When they roll a 6-</li></ul>
<p class="NoIndent">Generally when the players are just looking at you to find out what happens you make a soft move, otherwise you make a hard move.</p>
<p>A soft move is one without immediate, irrevocable consequences. That usually means it’s something not all that bad, like revealing that there’s more treasure if they can just find a way past the golem (offer an opportunity with cost). It can also mean that it’s something bad, but they have time to avoid it, like having the goblin archers loose their arrows (show signs of an approaching threat) with a chance for them to dodge out of danger.</p>
<p>A soft move ignored becomes a golden opportunity for a hard move. If the players do nothing about the hail of arrows flying towards them it’s a golden opportunity to use the deal damage move.</p>
<p>Hard moves, on the other hand, have immediate consequences. Dealing damage is almost always a hard move, since it means a loss of HP that won’t be recovered without some action from the players.</p>
<p>When you have a chance to make a hard move you can opt for a soft one instead if it better fits the situation. Sometimes things just work out for the best.</p>
<h3>Choosing a Move</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">To choose a move, start by looking at the obvious consequences of the action that triggered it. If you already have an idea, think on it for a second to make sure it fits your agenda and principles and then do it. <strong>Let your moves snowball</strong>. Build on the success or failure of the characters’ moves and on your own previous moves.</p>
<p>If your first instinct is that this won’t hurt them now, but it’ll come back to bite them later, great! That’s part of your principles (think offscreen too). Make a note of and reveal it when the time is right.</p>
<h3>Making your Move</h3>
<p class="NoIndent">When making a move, keep your principles in mind. In particular, never speak the name of your move and address the characters, not the players. Your moves are not mechanical actions happening around the table. They are concrete events happening to the characters in the fictional world you are describing.</p>
<p>Note that “deal damage” is a move, but other moves may include damage as well. When an ogre flings you against a wall you take damage as surely as if he had smashed you with his fists.</p>
<p>After every move you make, always ask “What do you do?”</p>
<h4>Use a monster, danger, or location move</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Every monster in an adventure has moves associated with it, as do many locations. A monster or location move is just a description of what that location or monster does, maybe “hurl someone away” or “bridge the planes.” If a player move (like hack and slash) says that a monster gets to make an attack, make an aggressive move with that monster.</p>
<p>The overarching dangers of the adventure also have moves associated with them. Use these moves to bring that danger into play, which may mean more monsters.</p>
<h4>Reveal an unwelcome truth</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">An unwelcome truth is a fact the players wish wasn’t true: that the room’s been trapped, maybe, or that the helpful goblin is actually a spy. Reveal to the players just how much trouble they’re in.</p>
<h4>Show signs of an approaching threat</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">This is one of your most versatile moves. “Threat” means anything bad that’s on the way. With this move, you just show them that something’s going to happen unless they do something about it.</p>
<h4>Deal damage</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">When you deal damage, choose one source of damage that’s fictionally threatening a character and apply it. In combat with a lizard man? It stabs you. Triggered a trap? Rocks fall on you.</p>
<p>The amount of damage is decided by the source. In some cases, this move might involve trading damage both ways, with the character also dealing damage.</p>
<p>Most damage is based on a die roll. When a player takes damage, tell them what to roll. You never need to touch the dice. If the player is too cowardly to find out their own fate, they can ask another player to roll for them.</p>
<h4>Use up their resources</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Surviving in a dungeon, or anywhere dangerous, often comes down to supplies. With this move, something happens to use up some resource: weapons, armor, healing, ongoing spells. You don’t always have to use it up permanently. A sword might just be flung to the other side of the room, not shattered.</p>
<h4>Turn Their Move Back On Them</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Think about the benefits a move might grant a character and turn them around in a negative way. Alternately, grant the same advantage to someone who has it out for the characters. If Ivy has learned of Duke Horst’s men approaching from the east, maybe a scout has spotted her, too.</p>
<h4>Separate Them</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">There are few things worse than being in the middle of a raging battle with blood-thirsty owlbears on all sides—one of those things is being in the middle of that battle with no one at your back.</p>
<p>Separating the characters can mean anything from being pushed apart in the heat of battle to being teleported to the far end of the dungeon. Whatever way it occurs, it’s bound to cause problems.</p>
<h4>Give an opportunity that fits a class’ abilities</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">The thief disables traps, sneaks, and picks locks. The cleric deals with the divine and the dead. Every class has things that they shine at—present an opportunity that plays to what one class shines at.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be a class that’s in play right now though. Sometimes a locked door stands between you and treasure and there’s no thief in sight. This is an invitation for invention, bargaining, and creativity. If all you’ve got is a bloody axe doesn’t every problem look like a skull?</p>
<h4>Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Just as every class shines, they all have their weaknesses too. Do orcs have a special thirst for elven blood? Is the cleric’s magic disturbing dangerous forces? The torch that lights the way also draws attention from eyes in the dark.</p>
<h4>Offer an opportunity, with or without cost</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Show them something they want: riches, power, glory. If you want, you can associate some cost with it too, of course.</p>
<p>Remember to lead with the fiction. You don’t say, “This area isn’t dangerous so you can make camp here, if you’re willing to take the time.” You make it a solid fictional thing and say, “Helferth’s blessings still hang around the shattered altar. It’s a nice safe spot, but the chanting from the ritual chamber is getting louder. What do you do?”</p>
<h4>Put someone in a spot</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">A spot is someplace where a character needs to make tough choices. Put them, or something they care about, in the path of destruction. The harder the choice, the tougher the spot.</p>
<h4>Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">This move is particularly good when they want something that’s not covered by a move, or they’ve failed a move. They can do it, sure, but they’ll have to pay the price. Or, they can do it, but there will be consequences. Maybe they can swim through the shark-infested moat before being devoured, but they’ll need a distraction. Of course, this is made clear to the characters, not just the players: the sharks are in a starved frenzy, for example.</p>

<h2>地城動作 (Dungeon Moves)</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">Dungeon Moves are a special subset that are used to make or alter a dungeon on the fly. Use these if your players are exploring a hostile area that you don’t already have planned completely.</p>
<p>Map out the area being explored as you make these moves. Most of them will require you to add a new room or element to your map.</p>
<ul><li>Change the environment</li>
<li>Point to a looming threat</li>
<li>Introduce a new faction or type of creature</li>
<li>Use a threat from an existing faction or type of creature</li>
<li>Make them backtrack</li>
<li>Present riches at a price</li>
<li>Present a challenge to one of the characters</li></ul>
<p class="NoIndent">You can make these moves whenever everyone looks to you to say something, when the players present you an opportunity, or when the players miss on a roll. They’re particularly well-suited for when the characters enter a new room or hallway and want to know what they find there.</p>
<h4>Change the environment</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">The environment is the general feel of the area the players are in: carved tunnels, warped trees, safe trails, or whatever else. This is your opportunity to introduce them to a new environment: the tunnels gradually become naturally carved, the trees are dead and strange, or the trails are lost and the wilderness takes over. Use this move to vary the types of areas and creatures the players will face.</p> 
<h4>Point to a looming threat</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">If you know that something is lurking and waiting for the players to stumble upon it, this move shows them the signs and clues. This move is the dragon’s footprints in the mud or the slimy trail of the gelatinous cube.</p>
<h4>Introduce a new faction or type of creature</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">A type of creature is a broad grouping: orcs, goblins, lizardmen, the undead, etc.</p>
<p>A faction is a group of creatures united by a similar goal. Once you introduce them you can begin to make moves and cause trouble for the players with those creatures or NPCs.</p>
<p>Introducing means giving some clear sensory evidence or substantiated information. Don’t be coy; the players should have some idea what you’re showing the presence of. You can, however, be subtle in your approach. No need to have the cultist overlord waving a placard and screaming in the infernal tongue every single time.</p>
<p>A hard application of this move will snowball directly into a combat scene or ambush.</p>
<h4>Use a threat from an existing faction or type of creature</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Once the characters have been introduced to the presence of a faction or type of creature you can use moves of monsters of that type.</p>
<p>Use the factions and types broadly. Orcs are accompanied with their hunting worgs. A mad cult probably has some undead servants or maybe a few beasts summoned from the abyssal pits. This is a move that, often, you’ll be making subconsciously—it’s just implementing the tools you’ve set out for yourself in a clear and effective manner.</p>
<h4>Make them backtrack</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Look back at the spaces you’ve added to the map. Is there anything useful there as yet undiscovered? Can you add a new obstacle that can only be overcome by going back there? Is there a locked door here and now whose key lies in an earlier room?</p>
<p>When backtracking, show the effect that time has had on the areas they’ve left behind. What new threats have sprung up in their wake? What didn’t they take care of that’s waiting for their return?</p>
<p>Use this move the make the dungeon a living, breathing place. There is no stasis in the wake of the characters’ passing. Add reinforcements, cave in walls, cause chaos. The dungeon evolves in the wake of the characters’ actions.</p>
<h4>Present riches at a price</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">What do the players want? What would they sacrifice for it?</p>
<p>Put some desirable item just out of reach. Find something they’re short on: time, HP, gear, whatever. Find a way to make what they want available if they give up what they have.</p>
<p>The simplest way to use this move is the promise of gold out of the way of the main objective. Will they stop to pry the ruby eyes from the idol when they know that the sacrifice looms closer and closer? Use this move and you can find out.</p>
<h4>Present a challenge to one of the characters</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Challenge a character by looking at what they’re good at. Give the thief a lock to pick, show the cleric servants of an enemy god to battle against. Give the wizard magical mysteries to investigate. Show the fighter some skulls to crack. Give someone a chance to shine.</p>
<p>As an alternative, challenge a character by looking at what they’re bad at or what they’ve left unresolved. If the bard has a complicated lie on his conscience, what steps will he take to cover it up when someone figures him out? If the wizard has been summoning demons, what happens when word gets out?</p>
<p>This move can give a character the spotlight—even if just for a moment. Try to give everyone a chance to be the focus of play using this move from session to session.</p>

<h2>常見情況的處理</h2>
<p class="NoIndent">在地城世界中總會出現一些常見的情況。這裡將說明這些情況的處理方法。</p>

<h4>戰鬥</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Sooner or later blades are drawn and blood is shed. When this happens the players are likely to start hacking and slashing, volleying, and defending. Think about more than just the exchange of damage. Monsters might be trying to capture the characters or protect something from them. Understand what the fight is about; what each side wants and how that might affect the tide of battle.</p>
<p>No self-respecting monster just stands still for their beating. Combat is a dynamic thing with creatures moving in and out of range, taking cover, and retreating. Sometimes the battlefield itself shifts. Have your monsters take action that the players will react to. Make sure you’re making use of moves beyond deal damage, even in a fight.</p>
<p>Make sure everyone has a chance to act, and that you know where each player is during the chaos of combat. Make a map of a complex battle location so that everyone knows just what’s happening and can describe their actions appropriately.</p>

<h4>陷阱</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Traps may come from your prep, or you can improvise them based on your moves. If nothing has established that the location is safe, traps are always an option.</p>
<p>The players may find traps through clever plans, trap sense, or discerning realities. If a character describes an action that doesn’t trigger a move, but the action would still discover a trap, don’t hide it from them. Traps aren’t allowed to break the rules.</p>

<h4>人際</h4>
<p class="NoIndent">Dwarven smiths, elven sages, humans of all shapes and sizes occupy the world around the characters. They’re not mindless stooges to be pushed around but they’re not what we’re playing to find out about either. The NPCs are people: they have goals and the tools to struggle towards those goals. Use them to illustrate what the world is like. Show your players the common people struggling for recognition or the noble classes seeking to uplift their people. Some whole adventures might take place in a peopled environment rather than an isolated dungeon. Some classes, the bard in particular, are adept at manipulating and using people as resources. Don’t shy away from these situations. Be a fan of these characters, giving them interesting, nuanced people to interact with.</p>  
<p>People, just like dungeons, change over time. The passing of the characters through their lives might inspire or enrage them. The characters’ actions will cause the world to change, for good or ill, and the people they meet with will remember these changes. When the characters roll back through a town they were less-than-kind to on their previous visit, show them how the people are different now. Are they more cautious? Have they taken up a new religion? Are they hungry for revenge?</p>
<p>Relationships between characters are represented by the bonds but relationships with NPCs are more tenuous. If the players want to make real, lasting connections with the people of the world, they need to act. Remember, “what do you do?” is as valid a question when faced with the hopes and fears of a potential new ally or enemy as it is when staring down the business end of a longsword.</p>

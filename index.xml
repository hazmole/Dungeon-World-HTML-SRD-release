      <description>Advanced DelvingDungeon World portrays a specific kind of fantasy adventure—one with elves and dwarves, heroes and villains, and characters struggling for riches and glory in a dangerous world. Maybe you’ve got an idea for something different—maybe your Dungeon World is set on a blasted desert planet, peopled by savage cannibals and ruled by haughty psychics. Or maybe you want to play a game where humans are the only race available, but they belong to clans or families as different from each other as a gnome is from a dwarf.</description>

      <description>Adventure ConversionThere isn’t always time for prep. People aren’t entirely committed to a game—you just want to test it out or you’ve got a four-hour slot at a convention that you want to fill and you’ve never met the players before in your life. Maybe prep isn’t something you care about or you think it’s more fun to just take a map and run with it. Even better, maybe you’ve got a favorite old school adventure module and you’d love to run through using the Dungeon World rules.</description>

      <title>Basic Moves</title>

      <guid>https://hazmole.github.io/Dungeon-World-HTML-SRD-release/moves_discussion/</guid>
      <description>Basic MovesThis chapter contains the moves that are available to all characters. These moves fall into two categories: basic and special.
Basic moves are the bread and butter of the adventurer’s life. They cover situations likely to come up in fights, tense negotiations, and dangerous areas.
Special moves come up a little more rarely. They cover things like gaining a level, taking a long journey, or returning to town between adventures.</description>

      <description>Cavern Dwellers掘地蟲	Group, LargeBite (d8+1 damage), 10 HP, 3 Armor
Close, Reach
Special Qualities: Burrowing
A hide like plate armor and great crushing mandibles are problematic. A stomach full of acid that can burn a hole through a stone wall makes them all the worse. They’d be bad enough if they were proper insect-sized, but these things have the gall to be as long as any given horse.</description>

      <description>Character CreationMaking Dungeon World characters is quick and easy. You should all create your first characters together at the beginning of your first session. Character creation is, just like play, a kind of conversation—everyone should be there for it.
You may need to make another character during play, if yours gets killed for example. If so, no worries, the character creation process helps you make a new character that fits into the group in just a few minutes.</description>

      <description>RotesEvery time you commune, you gain access to all of your rotes without having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.
Light	Rote
An item you touch glows with divine light, about as bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel but is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.</description>

      <description>Dark WoodsAssassin Vine	Solitary, Stealthy, AmorphousThorns (d10 damage, 1 piercing), 15 HP, 1 Armor
Close, Reach, Messy
Special Qualities: Plant
Among the animals there exists a clear division ‘tween hunter and hunted. All it takes is a glance to know—by fangs and glowing eyes or claws or venomous sting—which of the creatures of this world are meant to kill and which stand to be killed. Such a split, if you have the eyes to see it, cuts the world of leaves and flowers in twain, as well.</description>

      <description>Example of PlayI’m GMing a game with Isaac (playing Omar), Ben (playing Brianne), Amy (playing Nora), and Dan (playing Rath). The group has come upon a tribe of goblins preparing the ritual sacrifice of a rare and valuable albino crocodile (highly regarded as pets among the wealthy of the city).
Three of the goblin warriors—drugged on narcotic vapors—charge the fighter Brianne, shrieking. Two others take cover, prepare their bows and gesture urgently toward Rath, as they make signs to ward off the evil eye.</description>

      <description>First SessionThe first session of a game of Dungeon World begins with character creation. Character creation is also world creation, the details on the character sheets and the questions that you ask establish what Dungeon World is like—who lives in it and what’s going on.
This section is for the GM so it’s addressed to you—the GM. For the players, the first session is just like every other. They just have to play their characters like real people and explore Dungeon World.</description>

      <description>Folk of the RealmAcolyte	“Can’t all be the High Priest, they said. Can’t all wield the White Spire, they said. Scrub the floor, they told me. The Cthonic Overgod don’t want a messy floor, do he? They said it’d be enlightenment and magic. Feh. It’s bruised knees and dishpan hands. If only I’d been a cleric, instead.” Instinct: To serve dutifully
Follow dogmaOffer eternal reward for mortal deedsAdventurer	Horde, IntelligentSword (d6 damage), 3 HP, 1 Armor</description>

      <guid>https://hazmole.github.io/Dungeon-World-HTML-SRD-release/gm/fronts/</guid>
      <description>FrontsFronts are secret tomes of GM knowledge. Each is a collection of linked dangers—threats to the characters specifically and to the people, places, and things the characters care about. It also includes one or more impending dooms, the horrible things that will happen without the characters’ intervention. “Fronts” comes, of course, from “fighting on two fronts” which is just where you want the characters to be—surrounded by threats, danger and adventure.</description>

      <description>Instant NPCsSometimes the players will come across someone who becomes important in the moment. When the ritual goes wrong and a poor captive gets the power cosmic what does that villager do with it? Who were they?
When you need a quick NPC all you need is an instinct and some way to pursue it. We call that a knack, it can be anything from a skill to a title to a debt owed.</description>

      <description>Lower DepthsAboleth	Group, Huge, IntelligentTentacle (d10+3 damage), 18 HP, 0 Armor
Reach
Special Qualities: Telepathy
Deep below the surface of the world, in freshwater seas untouched by the sun, dwell the aboleth. Fish the size of whales, with strange growths of gelatinous feelers used to probe the lightless shores. They’re served by slaves: blind albino victims of any race unfortunate enough to stumble on them, drained of thought and life by the powers of the aboleth’s alien mind.</description>

      <description>MonstersGreat heroes need horrendous antagonists. This section is about how to create and play as those antagonists—from the lowly goblin warrior to the hellish demon.
Using MonstersA monster is any living (or undead) thing that stands in the characters’ way.
How you use these monsters follows directly from your agenda and principles. Stay true to your principles, use your moves and pursue your agenda—you can’t go wrong. Your first agenda is to portray a fantastic world.</description>

When you first select a multiclass move that grants you the ability to cast spells you prepare and cast spells as if you had one level in the casting class.</description>

Close, Forceful
Special Qualities: Wings
“So was it written that the heavens opened up to Avra’hal and did an angel from the clouds emerge to speak unto her and so did it appear to her as her firstborn daughter—beautiful, of ebon skin and golden eyes—and did Avra’hal weep to see it.</description>

      <description>Playing the GamePlaying Dungeon World means having a conversation; somebody says something, then you reply, maybe someone else chimes in. We talk about the fiction—the world of the characters and the things that happen around them. As we play, the rules will chime in, too. They have something to say about the world. There are no turns or rounds in Dungeon World, no rules to say whose turn it is to talk.</description>

      <description>Ravenous HordesFormian Drone	Horde, Organized, CautiousBite (d6 damage), 7 HP, 4 Armor
Close
Special Qualities: Hive connection, Insectoid
With good cause, they say that these creatures (like all insects, really) are claimed by the powers of Law. They are order made flesh—a perfectly stratified society in which every larva, hatchling and adult knows its place in the great hive. The formian is some strange intersection of men and ants.</description>

      <description>Swamp DenizensBakunawa	Solitary, Large, Intelligent, Messy, ForcefulBite (d10+3 damage, 1 piercing), 16 HP, 2 Armor
Close, Reach
Special Qualities: Amphibious
Dragon-Turtle’s sister is a mighty serpent queen. Ten yards of scales and muscle, they say she wakes with a hunger when the sun disappears from the sky. She is attracted by bright light in the darkness and like any snake, the Bakunawa is sneaky. She will seek first to beguile and mislead and will only strike out with violence when no other option is available.</description>

      <description>Teaching the GameSince you’ve read this book it’s likely at some point you’ll be teaching the game to others, either experienced roleplayers or those new to the hobby. Throughout the design process we’ve had many chances to play with lots of different gamers from different backgrounds and there are a few things we’ve found work well for teaching the game.
Pitch ItBefore you play you’ll likely be explaining the game to your new players (don’t just spring it on them, that’s not cool).</description>

      <description>The BardThe poems say an adventurer’s life is all open roads and the glory of coin and combat. The tales told in every farmhand-filled inn have to have some ring of truth to them, don’t they? The songs to inspire peasantry and royals alike—to soothe the savage beast or drive men to a frenzy—have to come from somewhere.
Enter the bard. You, with your smooth tongue and quick wit. You teller-of-tales and singer-of-songs.</description>

      <guid>https://hazmole.github.io/Dungeon-World-HTML-SRD-release/classes/cleric/</guid>
      <description>The ClericThe lands of Dungeon World are a gods-forsaken mess. They’re lousy with the walking dead, beasts of all sorts, and the vast unnatural spaces between safe and temple-blessed civilizations. It is a godless world out there. That’s why it needs you.
Bringing the glory of your god to the heathens isn’t just in your nature—it’s your calling. It falls to you to proselytize with sword and mace and spell.</description>

      <description>The DruidCast your eyes around the fire. What has brought you to these people, stinking of the dust and sweat of the city? Perhaps it is a kindness—do you protect them as the mother bear watches over her cubs? Are they your pack, now? Strange brothers and sisters you have. Whatever your inspiration, they would certainly fail without your sharp senses and sharper claws.
You are of the sacred spaces; you are born of soil and wear the marks of her spirits on your skin.</description>

      <description>The FighterIt’s a thankless job—living day to day by your armor and the skill of your arm. To dive heedlessly into danger. They won’t be playing golden horns for the time you took that knife to the ribs for them in the bar in Bucksberg. No flock of angels to sing of the time you dragged them, still screaming, from the edge of the Pits of Madness, no.</description>

      <description>The GMThere are many different fantasy genres, each with their own style or advice for GMing. Dungeon World is designed for one of those styles in particular—a world of elves, orcs, dragons and magic where dark dangers mix with lighthearted adventure. The rules in this chapter will help you run a game in that style.
The characters have rules to follow when they roll dice and take actions. The GM has rules to follow, too.</description>

      <description>The PaladinHell awaits. An eternity of torment in fire or ice or whatever best suits the sins of the damned throngs of Dungeon World. All that stands between the pits of that grim torture and salvation is you. Holy man, armored war machine, templar of the Good and the Light, right? The cleric may say his prayers at night to the gods, dwelling in their heavens. The fighter may wield his sharp sword in the name of “good” but you know.</description>

Guide. Hunter. Creature of the wilds. You are these things and more. Your time in the wilderness may have been solitary until now, but the call of some greater thing—call it fate if you like—has cast your lot with these folk.</description>

      <description>The ThiefYou’ve heard them, sitting around the campfire. Bragging about this battle or that. About how their gods are smiling on your merry band. You count your coins and smile to yourself—this is the thrill above all. You alone know the secret of Dungeon World—filthy filthy lucre.
Sure, they give you lip for all the times you’ve snuck off alone but without you, who among them wouldn’t have been dissected by a flying guillotine or poisoned straight to death by some ancient needle trap?</description>

      <description>The WizardDungeon World has rules. Not the laws of men or the rule of some petty tyrant. Bigger, better rules. You drop something—it falls. You can’t make something out of nothing. The dead stay dead, right?
Oh, the things we tell ourselves to feel better about the long, dark nights.
You’ve spent so very long poring over those tomes of yours. The experiments that nearly drove you mad and all the botched summonings that endangered your very soul.</description>

      <description>The worldMuch of the adventuring life is spent in dusty, forgotten tombs or in places of terror and life-threatening danger. It’s commonplace to awaken from a short and fitful rest still deep in the belly of the world and surrounded by foes. When the time comes to emerge from these places—whether laden with the spoils of battle or beaten and bloody—an adventurer seeks out safety and solace.
These are the comforts of civilization: a warm bath, a meal of mead and bread, the company of fellow men and elves and dwarves and halflings.</description>

      <description>Twisted ExperimentsBulette	Solitary, Huge, ConstructBite (d10+5 damage, 3 piercing), 20 HP, 3 Armor
Close, Forceful
Special Qualities: Burrowing
A seasoned caravan guard learns to listen for the calls of a scout or sentry with a keen ear. A few extra seconds after the alarm is raised can mean life or death. Different cries mean different responses, too—a call of “orcs!” means draw your sword and steady for blood but a call of “bandits!</description>

Close, Reach, Forceful
Special Qualities: Many limbs, heads, and so on
Corpses sewn onto corpses make up the bulk of these shambling masses of dark magic. Most undead are crafted to be controlled—made to serve some purpose like building a tower or serving as guardians. Not so the abomination. The last aspect of the ritual used to grant fire to their hellish limbs invokes a hatred so severe that the abomination knows but one task: to tear and rend at the very thing it cannot have—life.</description>

      <description>簡介地城世界 (Dungeon World)地城世界是奇幻冒險的世界。是個充斥著魔法、神魔、善惡、律法與混沌的世界。勇敢的英雄闖蕩於大地上最危險的角落，追求財富與榮耀。
在地城世界中有形形色色的冒險者。精靈、人類、矮人與半身人都有屬於自己的英雄。他們之中有身穿鐵甲，無人能敵的戰場猛獸；有的則神秘莫測，呼喚並驅使著魔法的力量。這些尋求財寶與榮耀的，有神聖的牧師、有奸巧的盜賊、有強大的聖武士、還有更多更多。
然而，冒險並不只有輕鬆的英雄主義與高尚的英勇行徑。每當遊俠帶著他的朋友穿越古老森林時，數以百計的危險虎視眈眈地等著咬掉他的頭顱。或許，等待著他們的是流著口水的哥布林部隊，又或許，他們行經的是居住著灰衣女巫的詛咒之森？亦或者，一整群怨靈正飢渴地尋找著用以還魂的肉身屍體。可怕嗎？當然，但是財寶也在那裏。在危險深處，無數被世人遺忘的黃金珠寶和魔法散落在你所熟悉世界的陰暗夾縫之間。除了堅定勇敢的英雄們之外，又有誰能夠取回它們？
你和你的朋友就是那些英雄。你們踏足他人無法或不願涉足的險地。怪誕之物潛居於這個世界──你準備好面對牠們了嗎？
吟遊詩人 (The Bard)冒險者之詩乃是不斷向前之路，是錢幣與戰鬥的榮光。在那些鄉農滿座的酒館中被傳唱的故事，總有些許真實，對吧？那些鼓舞農民與國親的歌謠──那些撫慰野獸或讓人瘋狂的歌謠──必定其來有自。
當個詩人吧。來，帶著你的巧舌與機智。你說故事，你唱歌謠。一名尋常樂手只會複誦，而真正的吟遊詩人活在其中。繫上你的靴子吧，高貴的演說家。磨利那把小刀，接受呼喚。總得有人要與那些暴徒、惡棍與即將成為英雄的人們並肩作戰。又有誰比你更能傳誦自己的英雄故事？
沒有別人了。來吧。
牧師 (The Cleric)地城世界的大地就是個被神遺棄的爛攤子。在安全與被祝福的文明之間，佈滿了走動的死屍、各種的野獸、跟廣袤的超自然之地。那是個神不存在的世界，而這也正是為何需要你的原因。
將神之榮光帶給異教徒不只是你的本性──更是你的使命。你持著劍、槌和咒法宣教，劈開粗野的愚蠢之心，植入神聖之籽。有人說，最好讓神常伴你心。你知道那都是狗屁。神只住在刀鋒之上。
向這個世界證明，誰才是它的主宰。
德魯伊 (The Druid)環視火堆周圍，這些人滿是城市的塵埃與汗味，是什麼將你帶到這些人身邊？或許是慈愛吧──你是否如同母熊照看她的幼崽保護著他們？他們現在是你這群的嗎？你可真有群奇怪的兄弟姊妹。不管你有怎樣的靈感，沒有你銳利的感官和更銳利的獠爪，他們註定不會成功。
你屬於神聖之所；你出生於母土，你的身上戴著她的靈魂之印。你可能也曾有過凡人的生活，或許你也像他們曾居於都城，如今卻已非如此。你拋棄了停滯的定型。聆聽你盟友對他們所雕神像的祈禱，聆聽他們的宗教寓言故事，講述他們將在早已被你拋棄的破爛小鎮中找回的榮耀。
他們的諸神只是年幼的孩童，他們的鋼鐵只是虛假的保護。你走在古老的路上，披大地為衣。你會拿取屬於你的財寶，但你是否會走上與他們相同的路呢？只有時間知道。
戰士 (The Fighter)這是份爛差事－－日復一日靠著你的盔甲和手上技巧討生活，不顧一切地跳入危險之中。當你在巴爾斯伯格的酒吧為他們兩肋插刀時，沒有人為你吹奏黃金號角。當你將還在尖叫的他們從瘋狂深淵的邊緣拽出時，沒有成群天使為你合唱。什麼都沒有。忘了他們吧。
你這麼做是為了膽識與榮耀，是為了戰鬥的呼嘯、以及那熾熱的鮮血。你是鐵打的猛獸。你的朋友或許帶著鋼鑄的鋒刃，然而，戰士，你本身就是鋼鐵。當你的旅伴在荒野營火旁抱怨著他們的傷口，你則驕傲的背起自己的傷疤。
你即是銅牆鐵壁－－任憑所有撲向你的危險灰飛煙滅。最終，你會是站到最後的那一個。
聖武士 (The Paladin)地獄正在等候。或寒冰，或烈火，或地城世界中那些該死罪人們所應得的懲罰，構成了此地的永恆折磨。殘虐或者救贖，一切由你。神聖之士，戰爭機器，全善與光明的聖堂武士，是吧？牧師或許在夜裡向天界上蒼祈禱。戰士或許會以「善」之名揮舞利劍。但只有你知道，何謂善。
眾神之眼，之手，之殺戮神罰，這就是你。你所賜的乃是公義與美德－－乃是正義，乃是願景。你胸懷同伴們所欠缺的，純粹之意念。
所以引導這些愚者吧，聖武士。擔負起你的聖潔使命，將救贖帶到這個破爛世界。
敗者毋怨悽慘，對吧？
遊俠 (The Ranger)與你同行的這些都市兒童。他們可曾聽見孤狼的吠叫？可曾感受過東方荒蕪沙漠的狂風呼嘯？可曾如你那樣以弓刃狩獵？當然他媽的沒有。那就是為什麼他們需要你。
嚮導、獵手、荒野的造物。你遠遠不只如此。你在荒野中一向孤獨，但那偉大之物的呼喚－－或許可以稱之為命運－－將你與這些都市人的命連繫在了一起。他們或許勇敢。或許強大健壯。但只有你通曉這兩者間的秘密。
沒有你，他們就會迷失。在鮮血與黑暗之中燒出通往前方的道路吧，神行客。
The ThiefYou’ve heard them, sitting around the campfire. Bragging about this battle or that, or about how their gods are smiling on your merry band.</description>

      <title>裝備</title>
      <link>https://hazmole.github.io/Dungeon-World-HTML-SRD-release/equipment/</link>

      <guid>https://hazmole.github.io/Dungeon-World-HTML-SRD-release/equipment/</guid>
      <description>裝備在腐朽的墳墓與被世界遺忘的財寶堆中堆滿了許許多多有用的物品。戰士可以在其中找到一把嶄新的鋒利寶劍、而盜賊也許能從中偶然找到一瓶致命毒藥。大部分的物品都是尋常無奇──沒有魔法、也沒什麼真正獨特的特質。對於遊戲機制的動作來說，任何帶有魔法或獨樹一格的物品都會被視作凡物。此外，戰士的招牌武器也永遠不會被視作凡物。
每件裝備都會帶有複數個標籤。這些標籤將告訴你這件裝備會如何影響使用它的角色（像是 +護甲值），或暗示它該如何被使用（例如範圍標籤）。就如同《地城世界》中的其他事物，它們能夠引導你在遊戲中創造故事情節。比如說，如果一把武器帶有「不便」標籤，那麼這可能意味著當你在劈砍檢定中失敗時，這把武器會有很大的機會脫手，落到地面。
以下列出的絕非詳盡完整的清單──自由地創造你自己的標籤吧。
泛用裝備標籤這些泛用標籤可以適用於幾乎任何裝備。你會在防具、武器、和一般冒險工具上看到它們。
內服 (Applied): 它只有在你確切地讓目標服用、或混進他們嚥下的飲食內才會生效。
不便 (Awkward): 它相當笨重且難以使用。
+修正 (+Bonus): 它將改變你在特定情況下的行動成效。比如說「憶述見聞下次+1」或是「砍劈持續-1」等等。
n 金幣 (n coins): 它在正常情況下值多少錢。如果價格包括「－魅力」的文字，則將其價格減去購買者的魅力值（而非修正值）。
危險 (Dangerous): 使用它很容易讓你惹上麻煩。如果你與它互動時沒有準備適當的預防措施，則GM可以自由地描述你愚蠢行動的後果。
食物 (Ration): 它是可食用的，或多或少。
限定 (Requires): 它只對某些人有用。如果你無法滿足它的條件，則它的效果會減弱，或甚至完全無效。
緩慢 (Slow): 使用它需要花費數分鐘或更久的時間。
接觸 (Touch): 它需要透過直接接觸到目標肌膚的方式來被使用。
雙手 (Two-handed): 它需要兩隻手才能被有效地使用。
n 重量 (n weight): 計算列有重量的物品的總重，並與你的負載量相比較。未列有重量的東西不能被隨身攜帶。100枚標準面額的金幣為1 重量。有著相同價值的寶石或美術品可能會更輕或更重。
穿戴 (Worn): 你必須要穿戴它才能夠使用它。
n 使用次數 (n Uses): 它只能被使用 n 次。 武器 (Weapons)殺死怪物的並非武器，而是揮舞它們的人。這也是為什麼《地城世界》中的武器並沒有列出其傷害數據。武器的主要重點在於其標籤，用來描述這把武器的用途與特性。一把匕首的重點並不在於它能造成比其他刀劍更多或更少的傷害，而在於它的小巧靈活，且能輕易地在極近距離下重創對手。因此，法師手中匕首的威脅性，就很明顯不如技巧純熟的戰士手上的那把匕首。
武器標籤武器可能會帶有一些主要用以幫助你描述它們的標籤（例如「生鏽」或「閃閃發光」），但以下這些標籤除了描述的用途之外，還有著其他遊戲機制上的效果。
n 彈藥 (n Ammo): It counts as ammunition for appropriate ranged weapons.</description>
